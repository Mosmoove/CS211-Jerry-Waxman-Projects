# CS211-Jerry-Waxman-Projects
CS 211 Lab projects | Queens College

In this repository, I will be showcasing my CS 211 class projects that were done at Queens College. The projects that I've coded in C++ will have a deep dive into Object Oriented Programming as well as other programming principles that were assigned.

- 1D 8 Queens Problem: 
In this algorithm, we're asked to build a program to generate all possible solutions/positions for the 8x8 chessboard on queen, such that no two queens conflict each other. The program finds them all in a 1 dimensional array.

- 8 Numbers in a Cross:
This project is asked to write a program that would place numbers in 1-8 in a cross formation, such that no two adjacent cells contain consecutive integers. There are a total of 4 solutions after running the program from the terminal. Using an algorithm called backtracking, I was able to locate all the possible solutions in optimizing an efficiency and data structures.
   This is how the cross would look like:

 - 8 Queens:
 Similar to the 1D 8 queens, except we are using goto statements that provides us a foundation of the complex algorithm.
 - Fancy 8 Queens:
 This is also similar to the one above, except we are making them look fancier, so that it is more visualizing to see than just 0s and 1s.
 - Dumb 8 Queens:
 Again, pretty similar to the 1D 8 queens algorithm. However, the only difference that it makes is that it required more steps by adding for loops one on top of the other, which wouldn't be the best case if you are deteriming the time complexity of the program. Wouldn't recommend it, but that is an alternative way on how you would find all possible solutions of an 8x8 chessboard using a queen only.
 
 - Integration Problem:
 In this project we're asked to build a program of finding the integral of the functions: f(x) = x, f(x) = x^2 and f(x) = x^3 under a given specific interval using function pointers. Pointers allow us to  point to the memory address of the value that is being stored, which can be dereferenced later on. In function pointers, they can be used to create a function call to functions that are pointed by them.
 
 - K Bishop Problem:
 The goal of this project is to find the total number of solutions a bishop figure can be placed on an n x n chessboard when k <= n. If we found out the the number of bishops is greater than the one of the dimensions of the chessboard, n, the program terminates.
 
 - Stable Marriage:
 In this project, we're asked to find the total number of solutions in which couples are showing signs of instability. Suppose we have Man 0 and Woman 0 in a relationship and Man 1 and Woman 1 are also in a relationship. If Man 0 prefers to be with Woman 1, there is instability that this man prefers the new woman over the current woman, and vice-versa if Woman 1 favors Man 0. There are currently 2 solutions that we have geenrated from this console.
 Here's a look of what the console looks like:

- Towers of Hanoi:
An old school game of Towers of Hanoi that uses backtracking to find all possible solutions. Only one ring has to move one tower and the rings cannot be stacked unorderdly.
